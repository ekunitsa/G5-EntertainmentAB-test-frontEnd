# Test task for G5-EntertainmentAB company, front-end

Several blocks used bootstrap (test task requirement), I think that it is redundant here.

Image optimization: avif, webp.

wow.js used for animation blocks on scroll, slick slider for reviews.

The test task was posted with the permission of the company recruiter.
